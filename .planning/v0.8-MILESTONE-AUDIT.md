# Milestone Audit: v0.8 Nanie Multi-tenancy

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Passed

## Requirements Coverage
| ID | Requirement | Status | Verification |
|----|-------------|--------|--------------|
| GRP-01 | List Groups | Passed | `agent.mjs` handles `LIST_GROUPS` |
| GRP-02 | Selection UI | Passed | `app.jsx` renders group list in Preview |
| GRP-03 | Link Action | Passed | `SELECT_GROUP` action updates mappings |
| GRP-04 | Auto-Rename | Passed | Confirmed in `agent.mjs` |
| MULTI-01 | Conversation Mapping | Passed | `mappings.json` persistence working |
| MULTI-02 | Request Routing | Passed | Messages routed by `groupId` |
| MULTI-03 | Unmapped Handling | Passed | Returns `GROUP_SELECTION_REQUIRED` |
| MEM-01 | Directory Structure | Passed | `nanie/memory/${groupId}/` used |
| MEM-02 | Context Scoping | Passed | Context limited to mapped group |
| MEM-03 | Broadcast Scoping | Passed | Events only sent to linked convs |

## Cross-Phase Integration
- **Frontend/Backend:** `LIST_GROUPS` and `SELECT_GROUP` handshake is robust.
- **State Management:** `ConversationContext` correctly isolates data, though some sync issues were found and fixed in Phase 14-02.

## E2E Flows
- **New User:** Can link a fresh conversation to an existing WhatsApp group.
- **Messaging:** Messages flow bi-directionally for linked groups.
- **Isolation:** Switching conversations switches context without leakage.

## Conclusion
The milestone objectives have been met. The system now supports multi-tenancy with proper isolation.
