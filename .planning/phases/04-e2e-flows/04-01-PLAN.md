# Phase 4 Plan: End-to-End Flows

## Goal
Validate the full user journey via Playwright (mocked).

## Requirements
- [ ] **INT-03**: UI displays Login Modal when token is missing.
- [ ] **INT-04**: UI renders Dashboard correctly when provided with mock financial data.
- [ ] **INT-05**: Auth flow (Mocked) works.

## Implementation Steps
1.  **E2E Tests**:
    -   Navigate to `/rafi/`.
    -   Verify "Connect via BankID" button exists.
    -   Click button, verify Login Modal.
    -   Mock the backend response (DATA) and verify Dashboard rendering.

## Verification
- Note: Playwright cannot run on Android. Verification is limited to configuration and script correctness.
